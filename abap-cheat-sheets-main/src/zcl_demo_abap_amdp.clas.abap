"! <h2>Note</h2>
"! <ul>
"! <li>The example covers the basics of AMDP method declarations and implementations.</li>
"! <li>The goal is to provide a general overview of AMDP, so the SQLScript code used in these
"! methods is quite simple. AMDP is usually not necessary for such simple cases.</li>
"! <li>This example is mainly intended for ABAP Cloud, where only read-only operations are
"! possible. In classic ABAP, there are more syntax options available. Refer to the ABAP
"! Keyword Documentation for more details and examples.</li>
